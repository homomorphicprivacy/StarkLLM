rem
rem  Windows marks files downloaded from the internet with a
rem  "Zone.Identifier" alternate data stream (the Mark of the Web).
rem  This causes SmartScreen to block .bat files on first run.
rem
rem  This script uses the built-in "unblock-file" logic via
rem  PowerShell (single command, no policy change required)
rem  to strip the Zone.Identifier from every file in this folder,
rem  then launches start.bat automatically.
